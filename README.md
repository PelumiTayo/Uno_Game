# Uno_Game

A slightly modified Python implementation of the popular game Uno. The game gives the user an option to play with a computer or with another player.

Each player begins with 7 cards. There is a top card that is randomly generated. Each player puts down a card that is either the same color or number as the top card. After 5 rounds the player with the least amount of cards wins.
